## Project summary

The dissertation aimed to explore the potential of deep learning algorithms for predicting stock prices. The research particularly focused on the inclusion feature selection of technical indicators Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Weighted Moving Average (WMA) to understand their impact on prediction accuracy.

The study aims to answer two questions. First, how effective are deep learning models like MLP, CNN, LSTM, and GRU in predicting stock price. Second, does the inclusion of technical indicators like RSI and WMA improve prediction accuracy across these models. The study was conducted using historical stock market data with four deep learning models (MLP, CNN, LSTM, GRU). Models were trained and tested to compare the performance based on close prices alone and the inclusion of RSI and WMA indicators. 

The research has found three significant findings. First, is that all deep learning models were capable of predicting stock prices to some extent which solidifies the usefulness of deep learning in financial market prediction. Second, LSTM was the only model to show improved performance when augmented with RSI and WMA. Third, the inclusion of RSI and WMA technical indicators did not significantly improve, but worsened, the performance of MLP, CNN, and GRU models.

  Given the results, it is advisable to further explore the potential of LSTMs in stock market prediction, particularly when multiple data features are involved. Additionally, future research could dive into optimizing these models, experimenting with other technical indicators, or applying these algorithms to different financial markets.
